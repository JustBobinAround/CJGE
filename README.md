Compact Java Game Engine - One Abstract Class, All Native Imports.

This is a game engine ment to be writen as one single abstract class in Java using only Java's native libraries. 
This is for a matter of simplicity in the hopes that it will help people jump into game developement more easily.
By not having to worry about messing with importing libraries and such, you're life will be stress-free. Instead,
simply download the class and add it to your project source. Extend the class just like you would a JFrame, and 
let your IDE add the unimplemented methods.
